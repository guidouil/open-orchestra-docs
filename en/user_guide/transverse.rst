Global page or transverse node
==============================

Each singular website has a global page (node transverse) per languages, it is a node containing blocks shared by several nodes.
This node allows to configure blocks, those blocks would then be available in all the other pages of this website.

Global pages have several languages, don't have a `workflow`_ and have only one version.

Transverse block
----------------

Transverse blocks are blocks defined in transverse node.
The block configuration can only be done in the transverse node

To contribute a transverse node, select a block in the block panel, drag and drop it on the area and contribute it.
Now a transverse blocks will be available in the block list.

The block list contains all the block available for the website:

* the configurable block
* the transverse block.

See also `managing block in node`_ and `website configuration`_.
