Global Pages and Blocks
=======================

In Open Orchestra, one of the purposes is to simplify the creation of pages by using blocks including their own functionnality.
They must be configured according to this functionnality (see `Block creation`_ and `Block list`_).

Some blocks could have the same configuration parameters in many pages like header or footer block.
Global pages are containers allowing to store these globally configured blocks.
Such blocks are reusable in all pages.

They will appear with a blue background in the backoffice right panel whereas the other blocks appear in orange color.

The global pages could be accessed through the left menu of the backoffice.

Contribution of global pages works the same way as other pages (see `Node`_).
