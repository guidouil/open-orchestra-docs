Global Pages and Blocks
=======================

To limit the user work, Open Orchestra provide a way to contribute some part of
a website once it for all. This usage is grouped under the term of **Global page** and
**Global blocks**.

Global pages
------------

Global pages have several languages, don't have a `workflow`_, have only one version and can
be accessed through the left menu of the backoffice.

Contribution of global pages works the same way as other pages (see `Node`_).

Global blocks
-------------

Some blocks could have the same configuration parameters in many pages like header or
footer block. Global pages are containers allowing to store these globally configured blocks.

They will appear with a blue background in the backoffice right panel whereas the other
blocks appear in orange color.

Contribution of global blocks works the same way as other blocks (see `managing block in node`_)
